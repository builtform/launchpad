# How It Works

LaunchPad is a Claude Code plugin (published in the public Anthropic marketplace under the BuiltForm brand) that drops 38 slash commands, 36 sub-agents, and 16 skills into any repository. Once installed, it provides a structured pipeline from brainstorm to shipped PR, organized around four meta-orchestrators that chain specialized commands.

This guide walks the full pipeline day-to-day. For the "why" behind the design, see [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).

## Installing the plugin

### Quick install

Inside Claude Code, in the project where you want the commands:

```
/plugin install launchpad@builtform
```

Restart Claude Code. All `/lp-*` commands are now available.

BuiltForm is a public marketplace in the Anthropic plugin registry — no additional marketplace setup required.

### Verifying installation

After restart, type `/lp-` and Claude Code should autocomplete with LaunchPad commands. You can also confirm via `claude plugin list` in your terminal — LaunchPad should appear with version `1.0.0` and marketplace `builtform`.

### Install scopes

`/plugin install` supports three scopes:

- `--scope local` — scoped to the current project path only
- `--scope project` — scoped to the project; if you're on a team, others can install the same plugin
- `--scope user` — enabled globally for all projects

LaunchPad's `scripts/setup/init-project.sh` uses `--scope project` when it auto-installs the plugin in the template path.

### Updating

```
/plugin marketplace update builtform
/plugin uninstall launchpad --scope <same-scope>
/plugin install launchpad@builtform --scope <same-scope>
```

Restart Claude Code after updating. The install cache (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/builtform/launchpad/<version>/`) is a snapshot taken at install time, so uninstall + marketplace-update + reinstall is the supported refresh flow.

## The template path (greenfield only)

If you want a fresh TypeScript + Next.js + Hono monorepo with LaunchPad pre-installed, use the template path instead.

### Run the wizard

```bash
cd ~/dev
git clone https://github.com/builtform/launchpad my-project
cd my-project
./scripts/setup/init-project.sh
```

The wizard walks through:

1. **Project identity** — prompts for project name, description, copyright holder, contact email, and license (MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL-3.0, or Other).
2. **File swap** — replaces template placeholders, renames `package.json` name, updates `LICENSE`.
3. **Git remote rename** — renames the `origin` remote to `launchpad` (so `origin` is free for your own repo). Disables push to the `launchpad` remote.
4. **Plugin install** — runs `claude plugin install launchpad@builtform --scope project`. Graceful fallback with instructions if the `claude` CLI isn't on PATH.
5. **Archive** — moves original LaunchPad documentation to `.launchpad/HOW_IT_WORKS.md` and `.launchpad/METHODOLOGY.md` for reference.

Then create your GitHub repo (leave all "Initialize" options unchecked), point `origin` at it, push:

```bash
gh repo create my-project --private
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

Install deps and start dev:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # set DATABASE_URL
pnpm dev                     # web :3000, API :3001
```

### Developer commands

| Command          | What it does                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`       | Start dev servers (web :3000, API :3001) |
| `pnpm build`     | Build all apps and packages              |
| `pnpm test`      | Run Vitest tests                         |
| `pnpm typecheck` | TypeScript type checking                 |
| `pnpm lint`      | ESLint across all workspaces             |
| `pnpm format`    | Auto-fix Prettier + ESLint               |

### Trimming what you don't need

The template is comprehensive by design. Delete what your project doesn't require:

| If you don't need... | Delete              | Also remove from                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend API          | `apps/api/`         | `turbo.json` tasks, `pnpm-workspace.yaml` if needed |
| Database / Prisma    | `packages/db/`      | `@repo/db` references in `apps/api/package.json`    |
| Compound automation  | `scripts/compound/` | —                                                   |
| Shared UI library    | `packages/ui/`      | `@repo/ui` references in `apps/web/package.json`    |

To pull future LaunchPad **scaffold** updates (compound scripts, CI workflows, init wizard improvements) into your project without touching application code, use `/lp-pull-launchpad` or `bash scripts/setup/pull-upstream.launchpad.sh`. Plugin content (commands, agents, skills) updates separately via the plugin-update flow above.

## The four meta-orchestrators

```
/lp-kickoff → /lp-define → /lp-plan → /lp-build
  brainstorm      definition     design+plan     build+ship
```

Each orchestrator owns a phase of the lifecycle. You can run them in sequence for a full feature, or invoke any one independently when resuming work.

### Status contract

Every section progresses through a strict status chain tracked in its spec file's YAML frontmatter:

```
defined → shaped → designed / "design:skipped" → planned → hardened → approved → reviewed → built
```

Each meta-orchestrator checks this status before proceeding and refuses to run if the section is not at the expected stage. Registry integrity is validated at every transition — the harness refuses to proceed if artifacts are missing for the current status (e.g., status is `approved` but `approved_at` field is absent).

---

## Phase 1 — Kickoff

**`/lp-kickoff`** delegates to `/lp-brainstorm` for collaborative idea exploration, then hands off to `/lp-define`.

`/lp-brainstorm` loads the brainstorming skill, dispatches research agents when a codebase exists (`file-locator`, `pattern-finder`, `docs-locator`), guides structured one-question-at-a-time dialogue, and captures a design document to `docs/brainstorms/` (with YAML frontmatter and PII/secret scanning pre-capture). It never writes code.

Output: a brainstorm doc at `docs/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` plus a literal transition message suggesting `/lp-define` next.

---

## Phase 2 — Definition

**`/lp-define`** chains four commands in sequence:

1. **`/lp-define-product`** — Interactive Q&A producing `PRD.md` and `TECH_STACK.md`
2. **`/lp-define-design`** — Produces `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `APP_FLOW.md`, `FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md`
3. **`/lp-define-architecture`** — Produces `BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md` and `CI_CD.md`
4. **`/lp-shape-section [name]`** — Deep-dive per section producing `docs/tasks/sections/[name].md` (up to 3 per session)

Each command detects existing artifacts and runs in update mode when they exist. After shaping, sections have status `shaped`.

### What `/lp-define` also seeds

Beyond the architecture docs, `/lp-define` is the authoritative seeder for:

- **`.launchpad/config.yml`** — harness config. Keys: `commands` (test/typecheck/lint/build), `paths` (architecture_dir, tasks_dir, sections_dir, plans_file_pattern), `pipeline` (plan.design_review, build.test_browser), `audit.committed`, `version`.
- **`.launchpad/agents.yml`** — stack-aware agent roster. Keys: `review_agents`, `review_db_agents`, `review_design_agents`, `review_copy_agents`, `harden_plan_agents`, `harden_plan_conditional_agents`, `harden_document_agents`, `protected_branches`. Stack-conditional rows (`lp-kieran-foad-ts-reviewer` only when `ts_monorepo` is detected, etc.).
- **`docs/tasks/SECTION_REGISTRY.md`** — canonical section registry (replaces the old "Product Sections table" in PRD.md).
- **`.launchpad/audit.log`** — appended to `.gitignore` automatically unless `audit.committed: true` is set in config.
- **`docs/tasks/sections/`** — created if absent (realpath-confined).

Stack detection runs deterministically: the output is sorted alphabetically for `stacks` and `manifests`, so re-running `/lp-define` with no semantic changes produces bit-identical output.

### Copy workflow

For public-facing pages, `/lp-shape-section` prompts to create page copy via the `web-copy` skill (if installed). Copy informs design, not the other way around.

---

## Phase 3 — Planning

**`/lp-plan`** resolves the target section from the registry, checks its status, and routes to the appropriate step. This is the most complex orchestrator.

### Step 1 — Resolve target

Reads the section spec's YAML frontmatter `status:` field and routes:

| Current status                   | Route to                     |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `hardened`                       | Step 5 (approval)            |
| `planned`                        | Step 4 (harden)              |
| `designed` or `"design:skipped"` | Step 3 (plan)                |
| `shaped`                         | Step 2 (design)              |
| `defined` or no status           | "Not shaped. Run /lp-define" |

### Step 2 — Design workflow

Runs before planning so the plan incorporates concrete design decisions. UI detection parses the section spec for UI keywords (component, page, layout, modal, form, dashboard, etc.) and file references containing `apps/web/` or `packages/ui/`. The user can always skip design, setting status to `"design:skipped"`.

| Sub-step                         | What happens                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **2a — Autonomous first draft**  | Loads design skills (`frontend-design`, `web-design-guidelines`, `responsive-design`) and copy context. Builds UI components following design system tokens, opens browser (agent-browser or Playwright), screenshots and self-evaluates for 3–5 auto-cycles via `design-iterator`. Presents first draft with live localhost URL.                                              |
| **2b — Interactive refinement**  | User gives feedback; dispatches `design-iterator` (one change per iteration). Supports Figma sync (`figma-design-sync`) and systematic polish (`/lp-design-polish`).                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **2c — Design review and audit** | Runs `/lp-design-review` first (8 design + 4 tech dimensions, AI slop detection), then in parallel: `design-ui-auditor` (5 checks), `design-responsive-auditor` (6 checks), `design-alignment-checker` (14 dimensions), `design-implementation-reviewer` (Figma comparison, conditional), `/lp-copy-review` (dispatches `review_copy_agents`). Re-audit cap: 3 cycles maximum. |
| **2d — Walkthrough recording**   | Optional `/lp-feature-video` — captures screenshots, stitches into MP4+GIF, uploads via rclone or imgup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Step 3 — Plan

Runs `/lp-pnf [section]` — research-first planning with sub-agents in the same two-wave pattern as definition (Discovery → Analysis). Produces an implementation plan at the path expanded from `paths.plans_file_pattern` (default `docs/tasks/sections/{section_name}-plan.md`). Status becomes `planned`.

**Conditional skill loading.** `/lp-pnf` auto-loads additional skills based on the section spec: `react-best-practices` (70 rules across 9 categories) when the section references frontend pages / components / UI, and `stripe-best-practices` when it references payment / billing / checkout / Stripe. Both skills are loaded in addition to the base planning context.

### Step 4 — Harden

Runs `/lp-harden-plan` to stress-test the plan. Modes:

- **`--full`** — all agents (for section builds)
- **`--lightweight`** — core agents only (standalone features)
- **`--auto`** — auto-apply findings without prompting
- **`--interactive`** — present each finding for accept/reject/discuss (default from `/lp-plan`)

Hardening includes: document quality pre-check (Step 2), learnings scan from `docs/solutions/` via `learnings-researcher` (Step 2.5, parallel with Step 2.7), Context7 technology enrichment (Step 2.7, parallel with Step 2.5), code-focused agent dispatch (Step 3), document-review agent dispatch (Step 3.5, 7 agents including conditional `design-lens-reviewer` for UI sections), and interactive deepening (Step 3.7). Idempotent: skips if plan already has `## Hardening Notes`. Status becomes `hardened`.

### Step 5 — Human approval

Presents plan summary with hardening notes and design status. Four options:

| Choice            | Effect                                                                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **yes**           | Status → `approved`; records `approved_at` + `plan_hash`; proceeds to `/lp-build` |
| **revise design** | Reset to `shaped`, clear design artifacts, restart Step 2                         |
| **revise plan**   | Reset to `designed`/`"design:skipped"`, restart Step 3 (design preserved)         |
| **revise both**   | Reset to `shaped`, clear everything, restart Step 2                               |

---

## Phase 4 — Build

**`/lp-build`** is fully autonomous. Before anything runs, it validates preconditions:

### Step 0 — Preflight

- **Autonomous-mode acknowledgment** — `.launchpad/autonomous-ack.md` must exist as a tracked file. It's a social/review signal, not a cryptographic gate, but having the file tracked in git blame makes autonomous-execution authorization visible.
- **Commands-hash check** — `LP_CONFIG_REVIEWED` env var must match either the full 64-char sha256 of the canonical `commands:` block or its 16-char prefix. The audit log records the 16-char prefix for readability; both forms validate.
- **Integrity guard** — refuses to run if the section spec and `autonomous-ack.md` were introduced in the same commit (the exact pattern a hostile PR would use to bypass review).
- **Audit entry** — appends one line to `.launchpad/audit.log` with ISO timestamp, git user, commit SHA, content-hash of commands, and the invoking command name.
- **Pipeline skip gates** — honors `pipeline.build.test_browser: skipped` from config for backend-only projects.

### Execution steps

| Step | Command                     | What happens                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `/lp-inf`                   | Execute plan: create feature branch, fresh-context loop (up to 25 iterations via `build.sh`), quality sweep.                                                         |
| 2    | `/lp-review`                | Multi-agent parallel review (interactive mode).                                                                                                                      |
| 2.5  | `/lp-resolve-todo-parallel` | Up to 5 concurrent resolver agents, groups overlapping files sequentially, durable fix commit.                                                                       |
| 3    | `/lp-test-browser`          | Maps changed files to UI routes (max 15), tests each (30s per route). Gracefully skips if no browser tool or no UI routes. Findings are informational, not blocking. |
| 4    | `/lp-ship`                  | Quality gates, commit, push, PR creation, 3-gate CI monitoring. **Never merges.**                                                                                    |
| 5    | `/lp-learn`                 | 5-agent parallel research pipeline writes structured solution doc to `docs/solutions/`.                                                                              |
| 6    | Report                      | Sets status to `built`, prints summary, runs `/lp-regenerate-backlog --stage`.                                                                                       |

**Preview mode.** `/lp-inf --dry-run` shows which section, plan file, and branch name would be used — without running the build loop. Useful when `/lp-inf` auto-picks from the registry (CASE B) and you want to verify the priority selection before committing to an autonomous run.

## Key commands reference

### `/lp-review`

Multi-agent code review with confidence-based false-positive suppression.

- Dispatches agents from `.launchpad/agents.yml` in parallel (code, DB, design, copy agents)
- Pre-dispatch secret scan on added lines using `.launchpad/secret-patterns.txt`
- Confidence scoring (0.00–1.00) per finding. Threshold: **0.60**. Findings below threshold are suppressed with audit trail in `.harness/review-summary.md`
- Boosters: multi-agent agreement (+0.10), security concerns (+0.10), P1 floor (minimum 0.60)
- PR intent verification: findings contradicting stated PR intent are suppressed
- Writes actionable findings to `.harness/todos/`, suppressed findings to review summary
- **`--headless` mode:** identical pipeline but suppresses interactive output. Used by `/lp-harden-plan` and `/lp-commit`

**Confidence tiers:**

| Tier        | Range     | Meaning                                           |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Certain     | 0.90–1.00 | Verified bug or security vulnerability with proof |
| High        | 0.75–0.89 | Strong evidence, clear code path to failure       |
| Moderate    | 0.60–0.74 | Reasonable concern, benefits from review          |
| Low         | 0.40–0.59 | Possible issue, limited evidence                  |
| Speculative | 0.20–0.39 | Theoretical concern, no concrete evidence         |
| Noise       | 0.00–0.19 | Generic advice, not actionable                    |

Only Moderate-and-above findings reach `.harness/todos/`. The six false-positive suppression categories (pre-existing issues, style nitpicks, intentional patterns, handled-elsewhere, code restatement, generic advice) filter the rest.

### `/lp-ship`

Autonomous shipping pipeline. Stages tracked files, runs quality gates (parallel `pnpm test` / `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm lint` + pre-commit hooks, with 3-attempt auto-fix), generates a conventional commit, pushes, creates a PR, and enters a 3-gate monitoring loop (CI checks, Codex review, merge conflicts). **Never merges.**

### `/lp-commit`

Interactive commit workflow with optional code review chain:

1. Branch guard (refuses to commit on main/master, suggests branch name)
2. Stage and review (user selects files)
3. Optional code review: `/lp-review --headless` → `/lp-triage` → `/lp-resolve-todo-parallel`
4. Skill staleness audit (non-blocking)

### `/lp-harden-plan`

Stress-tests implementation plans. Dispatches code-focused agents and document-review agents. Includes learnings scan from `docs/solutions/`, Context7 technology enrichment, and interactive deepening where each finding is presented for accept/reject/discuss. Idempotent (skips if `## Hardening Notes` exists).

### `/lp-triage`

Interactive triage of review findings in `.harness/todos/`. Presents each finding one-by-one (sorted P1 → P2 → P3, grouped by same file:line); user sorts into fix (ready), drop (dismissed), or defer (backlog). Overflow cap: if more than 25 pending findings, top 25 are presented and the rest are auto-deferred.

`/lp-triage` is the **human-invoked inflection point in the compound-learning feedback loop**: without it, review findings accumulate in `.harness/todos/` without direction. With it, you explicitly route each finding toward `/lp-resolve-todo-parallel` (fix now), `/lp-learn` (capture as a learning), or the backlog (defer) — and that's what feeds the next cycle's plan better than the last one.

### `/lp-learn`

Captures learnings from resolved problems. Loads the `compound-docs` skill, spawns 5 inline research sub-agents in parallel (Context Analyzer, Solution Extractor, Related Docs Finder, Prevention Strategist, Category Classifier), writes structured YAML-frontmatter solution docs to `docs/solutions/[category]/`.

### `/lp-test-browser`

Dual browser support: agent-browser CLI (primary, 93% fewer tokens) or Playwright MCP (fallback). Self-scoping — maps changed files to UI routes. Graceful skip when no browser tool, no dev server, or no UI routes detected.

### `/lp-brainstorm`

Collaborative idea exploration. Loads brainstorming skill, dispatches research agents, guides structured dialogue, captures design document to `docs/brainstorms/`. Never writes code.

## Learnings catalog

Every `/lp-inf` run captures learnings into structured files at `docs/solutions/[category]/`. Knowledge flows through four stages, from transient per-iteration notes to permanent project rules:

1. **During iteration.** The build agent documents learnings in `scripts/compound/progress.txt` as it works. The next iteration reads this file as part of its fresh-context bootstrap — so one iteration's discovery shortcuts the next.
2. **After completion.** `/lp-learn` (Step 5 of `/lp-build`) spawns 5 parallel research sub-agents (Context Analyzer, Solution Extractor, Related Docs Finder, Prevention Strategist, Category Classifier) and writes a structured solution doc to `docs/solutions/[category]/YYYY-MM-DD-[slug].md` with YAML frontmatter.
3. **Human review.** You review `docs/solutions/` periodically and promote the most valuable patterns to `docs/solutions/compound-product/patterns/promoted-patterns.md` — a staging area for graduation.
4. **Graduation.** Promoted patterns move into `CLAUDE.md` as permanent project rules. Every future AI session starts with those rules pre-loaded, so the pattern compounds forever.

### The compound-docs taxonomy

The `compound-docs` skill defines the vocabulary every solution doc is classified against — **14 categories** for classifying problems (e.g., database, api, auth, deployment, testing), **16 components** for identifying affected system parts, and **17 root causes** for diagnosing why problems occurred. This is what makes the catalog searchable by `learnings-researcher` during later planning cycles.

### Solution document format

Each solution doc opens with YAML-validated frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Feature Name
category: database
component: prisma-client
root_cause: missing-null-check
resolution_type: code-fix
severity: medium
tags: [prisma, n+1, query-optimization]
modules_touched: [packages/db, apps/api]
---
```

Safety gates: YAML validation blocks write if frontmatter is invalid. A secret scan redacts API keys, tokens, and passwords before writing.

The pipeline is designed so that a 30-minute fix becomes a seconds-long pattern match on next occurrence, and eventually a rule that prevents the problem entirely.

## Kanban board

`scripts/compound/board.sh` renders task progress from `prd.json` (the structured task file that `/lp-inf` creates from your plan). It's rendered automatically after each loop iteration inside `/lp-inf`, so you can watch progress in real time; you can also invoke it manually.

| Mode     | Flag        | Use case                                   |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| ASCII    | (default)   | Terminal output during `/lp-inf` loops     |
| Markdown | `--md`      | VS Code markdown preview, PR descriptions  |
| Summary  | `--summary` | Single-line status for CI logs, monitoring |

## Canonical files

These are the files that define how the project behaves — the control plane every session reads from.

**AI instructions** (what AI agents read before every session):

| File                                   | Purpose                                                                                                                               |

| `AGENTS.md`                            | Same instructions adapted for non-Claude tools reading the template scaffold (context only — agentic capabilities live in the plugin) |

## Skills

Skills are reusable instruction sets in `plugins/launchpad/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` that change how the AI reasons about specific problem domains. They're loaded automatically when trigger phrases appear.

| Command            | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `/lp-create-skill` | Create a new skill using the 7-phase Meta-Skill Forge |
| `/lp-port-skill`   | Import an external skill from GitHub or local files   |
| `/lp-update-skill` | Iterate on an existing skill after real-world usage   |

Two tracking files in `docs/skills-catalog/` provide visibility: `skills-index.md` (all installed skills with descriptions and triggers) and `skills-usage.json` (last-used dates, updated automatically by a PostToolUse hook). A session-end hook audits for stale skills unused for 14+ days.

---

## Quality gates

Every change passes through:

1. **Pre-commit hooks (Lefthook, template path)** — formatting, linting, type checking, structure validation, large file guard.
2. **CI pipeline (GitHub Actions, template path)** — lint, typecheck, test, build, structure check.
3. **AI review** — multi-agent confidence-scored review (P1/P2/P3 severity). Works in both plugin and template paths.

### Pre-commit hooks (Lefthook)

Seven hooks run on every commit, ordered by priority — auto-fixers first, then validators that block the commit on failure:

**Auto-fixers (priority 1–2):**

| Priority | Hook           | What it does         |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| 1        | `prettier-fix` | Format staged files  |
| 2        | `eslint-fix`   | Auto-fix lint issues |

**Validators (priority 10 — block commit on failure):**

| Hook                  | What it does                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `typecheck`           | TypeScript strict mode                           |
| `structure-check`     | Repo structure rules (`check-repo-structure.sh`) |
| `large-file-guard`    | Block files over 500KB in tracked extensions     |
| `trailing-whitespace` | No trailing whitespace                           |
| `end-of-file-newline` | POSIX-compliant file endings                     |

### Three-layer merge prevention

1. **Command prohibition** — `/lp-ship` and `/lp-commit` explicitly refuse to run `gh pr merge` or `git merge main`.
2. **PreToolUse hook** — intercepts merge commands at the tool level before execution (template path).
3. **GitHub branch protection** — server-side rules requiring approvals before merge.

---

## CI/CD (template path)

Every PR to `main` runs six jobs on GitHub Actions:

- `install` — cached `node_modules`, fans out to the check jobs
- `lint`, `typecheck`, `build`, `test` — run in parallel
- `structure` — `check-repo-structure.sh` (repository layout rules)
- `summary` — aggregate status gate

Additionally, **Codex posts an AI review** with P0–P3 severity ratings on every PR. Both `/lp-inf` and `/lp-commit` monitor for P0/P1 issues automatically when they open PRs.

### Required GitHub Secret for Codex review

Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your GitHub repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions). Without it, the Codex review job skips silently.

Other CI-relevant env vars live in the [Environment variables](#environment-variables-template-path-only) table below — `LP_CONFIG_REVIEWED` is specifically the CI-side pin that unblocks autonomous `/lp-build` runs under the content-hash audit.

---

## Security considerations

**LaunchPad runs agents with elevated permissions.** Understand the risks before using.

### What the agents can do

- Read and modify any file in your repository
- Execute shell commands (build, test, lint, git operations)
- Make network requests (API calls, package installs, git push)
- Create branches, commits, and pull requests autonomously
- Run multi-iteration loops that analyze, implement, and ship code without human intervention

### Safeguards in place

1. **PRs, not direct merges.** All autonomous changes go through pull requests.
2. **Pre-commit hooks** (template path) — linting, formatting, structure validation run before every commit.
3. **Codex AI review** (template path) — independent AI reviewer flags P0/P1 issues on every PR before merge.
4. **Quality gates** — configurable checks (tests, type-checking, build) at each iteration boundary.
5. **Max iterations** — the compound loop stops after N iterations (default 25) to prevent runaway execution.
6. **Structure validation** (template path) — `check-repo-structure.sh` enforces file placement.
7. **Secrets via `.env.local`** — all API keys load from gitignored `.env.local`. No secrets inline in commands.
8. **Pre-dispatch secret scan** — `/lp-review` scans added lines against `.launchpad/secret-patterns.txt` (one regex per line — `sk-`, `ghp_`, `AKIA`, `-----BEGIN .* PRIVATE KEY-----`, etc.) before any review agents are dispatched. Findings block review.
9. **Autonomous-execution acknowledgment** — `.launchpad/autonomous-ack.md` must exist as a tracked file; absence blocks `/lp-build`.
10. **Commands-hash audit** — `LP_CONFIG_REVIEWED` env var must match the canonical commands hash; mismatch blocks `/lp-build`.
11. **Integrity guard** — `/lp-build` refuses if section spec and `autonomous-ack.md` were introduced in the same commit.
12. **Audit log** — `.launchpad/audit.log` (gitignored by default; opt-in via `audit.committed: true`) records every command with timestamp, git user, commit SHA, and content hash.

### Recommendations

- Review PRs carefully before merging — even with AI review, human judgment is the final gate.
- Run autonomous loops in a separate environment (VM, container) if concerned about file access.
- Use API keys with minimal scope (read-only where possible, repo-scoped tokens for GitHub).
- Never target production branches — always work on feature branches.
- Monitor the first few autonomous runs to understand agent behavior.
- Verify `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` before committing anything.

### Autonomous permission flags

The compound scripts bypass interactive approval prompts to enable unattended operation:

| Tool        | Flag                             |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Claude Code | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` |

### Recommended companion: Destructive Command Guard (dcg)

The `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag is what enables unattended operation, but it also removes the human prompt that would normally catch destructive shell commands. LaunchPad's built-in `PreToolUse` hook covers `gh pr merge`, `git merge main/master`, `git push --force`, push to `main`, and `gh pr review --approve` — but it does NOT cover `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fdx`, `DROP TABLE`, `chmod -R`, or other destructive patterns.

[Destructive Command Guard (dcg)](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard) by [@Dicklesworthstone](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone) is a third-party Rust binary that registers as a `PreToolUse` hook on the `Bash` tool and blocks recognized destructive operations before they execute. **It is strongly recommended for any unattended `/lp-build` run.**

Install path:

1. Install the Rust toolchain if not present (https://rustup.rs).
2. Clone the dcg repository and `cargo install --path .` per its README.
3. Register dcg as a `PreToolUse` hook in `~/.claude/settings.json` or your project's `.claude/settings.json` per dcg's setup instructions.
4. Verify by running a sample blocked command (e.g. `rm -rf /tmp/test-dcg`) and confirming it is intercepted.

LaunchPad does not bundle dcg, does not auto-install it, and does not check for its presence at startup. Whether to install it is your call. See [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md#recommended-companion-destructive-command-guard-dcg) for the full security context.

### Optional companion: MemPalace (session-memory recall)

LaunchPad's three-tier knowledge system (`.harness/progress.txt` → `docs/solutions/` → `CLAUDE.md`) covers structured artifacts but not verbatim transcript recall. If you context-switch between long-running projects and want to query "what did we say three sessions ago," pair LaunchPad with [MemPalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace) — an optional fourth tier covering raw transcript retrieval.

Setup is a four-line block per project. Full cookbook: [docs/guides/MEMPALACE_INTEGRATION.md](MEMPALACE_INTEGRATION.md).

LaunchPad does not bundle MemPalace and runs identically without it.

## Configuration

### `.harness/` — runtime directory

The `.harness/` directory is the runtime workspace for the harness. It's created per-project and gitignored — it holds session-specific artifacts, not source code.

| Subdirectory        | Purpose                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `todos/`            | Review findings written by `/lp-review` (YAML frontmatter + markdown)              |
| `observations/`     | Out-of-scope observations from `code-simplicity-reviewer` (feeds the backlog)      |
| `design-artifacts/` | Approved design screenshots (`[section]-approved.png`)                             |
| `screenshots/`      | Working screenshots from design-iterator cycles                                    |
| `review-summary.md` | Confidence-scored findings summary (including suppression audit trail)             |
| `harness.local.md`  | Project-specific review context read by all agents — the one file worth committing |

### `.launchpad/config.yml`

Seeded by `/lp-define`, owned by the project. Key fields:

| Field                                            | Purpose                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `commands.test` / `typecheck` / `lint` / `build` | Arrays of shell commands the harness runs for quality gates. Empty array = skip. Stack-adapted (e.g., `pnpm test` for TS monorepo, `pytest` for Python). |
| `paths.architecture_dir`                         | Default `docs/architecture`                                                                                                                              |
| `paths.tasks_dir`                                | Default `docs/tasks`                                                                                                                                     |
| `paths.sections_dir`                             | Default `docs/tasks/sections`                                                                                                                            |
| `paths.plans_file_pattern`                       | Default `docs/tasks/sections/{section_name}-plan.md`                                                                                                     |
| `pipeline.plan.design_review`                    | `enabled` or `skipped` (backend-only projects). Controls `/lp-plan` Step 2.                                                                              |
| `pipeline.build.test_browser`                    | `enabled` or `skipped`. Controls `/lp-build` Step 3.                                                                                                     |
| `audit.committed`                                | `false` (default) — `.launchpad/audit.log` is gitignored. `true` — opts in to tracked audit log.                                                         |
| `version`                                        | Harness config schema version.                                                                                                                           |

### `.launchpad/agents.yml`

Seeded by `/lp-define` with stack-aware defaults. Keys:

```yaml
review_agents: # Dispatched by /lp-review (always)
review_db_agents: # Dispatched when Prisma/schema changes detected
review_design_agents: # Dispatched when design artifacts exist
review_copy_agents: # Dispatched by /lp-copy-review (downstream populates)
harden_plan_agents: # Dispatched by /lp-harden-plan (both intensities)
harden_plan_conditional_agents: # Dispatched by /lp-harden-plan (--full only)
harden_document_agents: # Dispatched by /lp-harden-plan Step 3.5
protected_branches: # Read by /lp-ship, /lp-commit (default: [main, master])
```

Hand-edit freely — `/lp-define` never overwrites an existing `agents.yml`; only `/lp-define` seeds it, and re-seeding is explicit.

### Environment variables (template path only)

| Variable             | Required    | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`       | Yes         | PostgreSQL connection string                                                                       |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`  | No          | For compound automation scripts                                                                    |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | Conditional | Required in GitHub Secrets to enable Codex review on PRs                                           |
| `LP_CONFIG_REVIEWED` | Conditional | Full or 16-char prefix of canonical commands hash; required in CI to unblock `/lp-build` preflight |

Print the current canonical hash with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/plugin-config-hash.py`.

## Maintenance

### Updating the plugin

```
/plugin marketplace update builtform
/plugin uninstall launchpad --scope <same-scope>
/plugin install launchpad@builtform --scope <same-scope>
```

Restart Claude Code after updating.

### Template path: pulling upstream scaffold updates

If you cloned via the template path with `git remote rename origin launchpad`, you can pull future LaunchPad **scaffold** updates (compound scripts, CI workflows, init wizard) into your project without touching application code:

```
/lp-pull-launchpad
```

Or from a shell:

```bash
bash scripts/setup/pull-upstream.launchpad.sh
```

This is scaffold-only — plugin content (commands, agents, skills) updates separately via the plugin-update flow above. If you run `/lp-pull-launchpad` on a plugin-only install (no template scaffold present), it refuses with a pointer to the plugin-update flow.

If you disconnected from upstream (chose the "fresh start" option during init), compare against the [latest release](https://github.com/builtform/launchpad/releases) manually or re-clone.

### Refreshing a stale plugin cache

The plugin cache at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/builtform/launchpad/<version>/` is a snapshot taken at install time. After updating LaunchPad, always refresh via the uninstall + marketplace-update + reinstall flow above — the cache does not update in place.

## Troubleshooting

**Quality gates fail and block commit.** Run `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm lint` manually to see the full error. Fix the root cause. Never use `--no-verify`.

**Structure check: "Non-whitelisted file at root."** Move the file using the decision tree in `docs/architecture/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md` Section 7, or add it to the whitelist in `check-repo-structure.sh`.

**Structure check: "Found duplicate files."** Compare both versions with `diff`, keep the better one, delete the other. Do not auto-delete.

**`build.sh` fails: "jq / gh / lefthook not found."** Install the missing tool: `brew install jq`, `brew install gh`, or `brew install lefthook`.

**PR creation fails: "gh: not logged in."** Run `gh auth login` and verify with `gh auth status`.

**Codex review never runs on PRs.** Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to GitHub repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions). The Codex job skips silently if the secret is absent.

**`/lp-test-browser` reports no browser tool.** Install agent-browser (`npm install -g agent-browser && agent-browser install`) or ensure Playwright MCP is configured.

**Loop exits early.** Check `scripts/compound/progress.txt`. Common causes: tasks too large, quality checks failing repeatedly, context overflow. Break large tasks into smaller ones.

**Large file guard blocks commit.** Files over 500KB in tracked extensions are rejected. Add to `.gitignore` or split into smaller files.

**`/lp-build` refuses: "LP_CONFIG_REVIEWED does not match current commands section."** Regenerate the canonical hash with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/plugin-config-hash.py`, update the CI env var, re-run.

**`/lp-build` refuses: "Autonomous execution requires `.launchpad/autonomous-ack.md`."** Create the file with a one-paragraph acknowledgment of autonomous-execution risks, commit it, then re-run.

**L2 commands (`/lp-commit`, `/lp-review`, `/lp-ship`, `/lp-harden-plan`) halt at Step 0 Lite with "run /lp-define."** `.launchpad/agents.yml` is missing — run `/lp-define` to seed it. `/lp-define` is the authoritative seeder for that file.

**Plugin commands aren't available after install.** Restart Claude Code. If still missing, verify install: `claude plugin list`. If installed but commands aren't registering, the cache may be stale — uninstall + marketplace-update + reinstall.

**`/lp-pull-launchpad` refuses with "plugin-only install detected."** This is expected — the command only updates template-path scaffold. For plugin content updates, use the plugin-update flow (`/plugin marketplace update builtform` + uninstall + reinstall).
